# Teamseeker

This project was made for an Android Studio class in the second CS semester at Unversity of Regensburg.
The application allows for events to be created on a map by users. Other users can see and filter events by type, distance and other things.
Events can be joined, which provides participants with a list of the other participants and an arbitrary chat.
Users can create simple profiles with names, birthdays and profile pictures to give other users an idea of their person.

The app uses Google's Firebase service to allow user login and persistent profile data across devices.
Firebase services are also used for saving events in the cloud for easier access.
The chat consists of metadata objects in a database which turned out to be a very flawed solution.

The project was submitted on 9.9.2018 by Fabian Schebera, Matthias Zerniekel and Nicole Sch√∂nwerth.
The pdfs in the repository are descriptions of the project (No translation available).
